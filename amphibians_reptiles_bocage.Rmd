# Benefits of hedgerow landscape for species richness
Reptiles and amphibians are currently under threats that causes declines.
One of the main causes decline is loss of habitats, that is in part due to intensification of agricultural practices since ~60 years.

In such a context, we hypothesize that both groups are favored by extensive agricultural landscapes through heterogeneity of habitats characterized by linear structures (hedges, forest edges), ponds, pastures. Therefore, evolution of agricultural landscapes might be crucial for future conservation of these species.

* How current attributes at different scales (habitat vs. landscape) will influence species distribution?
* Will species richness and distribution be affected by changes of agricultural practices?

We predict that there is a correlation between species richness and distribution with density of linear landscape structures (hedges and forest edges, ponds), and that species richness will decrease in areas where linear structures decline.
We also predict different effects of variables according to the scale, with configuration variables having a strong effect at greater scales.

## Species data
We filtered 41 547 GPS-precise  data at a 100 m x 100 m pixel resolution to avoid oversampling (gathering of data at the same pond/hedges at different dates), which resulted in 20 019 points for 22 species.

### GLM

* I performed two glms for each species: 
  + one GLM with all variables, 
  + second GLM with significant variables from previous

* Selection of best model with AIC

# how to model past agricultural landscape? 
We have a data base of hedges (linear vector layer) from 1950 and 2020 in 31 1km-radius samples across the department. Comparison of these data sets show that there is a significant decline in hedges density during this period, and that there is a differentiated effect between the north and the south, with a sharper decline in the south.

* How can we use this data set to interpolate to the whole department?

* Is it relevant to use these data at a finer resolution (100 m x 100 m)?

# Future models

## How to build scenarios? 

* Constant rate of decline?

* Different rate according to the locality (roughly north/south)?


* Different rate according to acquired information from current practices?
